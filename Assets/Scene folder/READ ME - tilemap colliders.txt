1. the actual tilemap file (in your forst art folder) also needed a tilemap collider
2. I had to make a new tilemap (after the tilemap had been modified) for the colliders to work
3. the new tilemap also needs a tilemap collider
4. translucent sprites don't get colliders, so use an opaque tile for your walls
5. the colliders do stil work if you set the albedo to transparent, so you don't have to worry about sort order on this tilemap
